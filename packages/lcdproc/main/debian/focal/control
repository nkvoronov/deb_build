Description: LCD display driver daemon and clients
 Lcdproc is a client/server suite including drivers for all kinds of
 nifty LCD displays. The server supports several serial devices: Matrix
 Orbital, Crystal Fontz, Bayrad, LB216, LCDM001 (kernelconcepts.de),
 Wirz-SLI and PIC-an-LCD; and some devices connected to the LPT port:
 HD44780, STV5730, T6963, SED1520 and SED1330.
 .
 Various clients are available that display things like CPU load, system
 load, memory usage, uptime, and a lot more. Custom clients can be
 written using the simple client-server protocol and provided example
 code.
 .
 This package contains the LCD drivers which need no extra libraries to
 run. In the lcdproc-extra-drivers package some USB and VGA on-screen
 displays are also supported.
